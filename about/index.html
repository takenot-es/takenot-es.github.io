                    I’m a non-award-winning designer, leader, and occasional front-end developer. (It’s all politics anyway, and I never submit my work. So, not bitter at all.) Right now, I find myself working at the intersection of operations, branding, marketing, and systems. In simple terms, I help companies build their branding and then organize and operationalize it.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I’ve been designing for longer than I care to admit. If I’m being totally honest, I lost count of the years a while ago. It all started with a pirated version of Adobe Photoshop, making band materials for some of the groups I was in during my early 20s. That’s where I learned the fundamentals—not just of design, but also the soft skills that come with client work. Managing expectations, working to deadlines, and learning the hard way why contracts are absolutely essential in any freelance relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over the years, I’ve had the good fortune of working with some incredible companies, helping them grow through thoughtful design, strategy, and systematized development. Whether it's refining a brand, building out digital experiences, or improving internal processes, I’ve learned that good design is more than just aesthetics—it’s a key driver of growth and efficiency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I’m not hunched over a laptop, hitting Command + K in Figma or tweaking code in VS Code, you can usually find me doing one of three things: reading, playing guitar, or complaining about how sore my knees are (most likely from my last workout).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Oh, and while I haven’t quite hit the “smoking meat” phase of life yet, I’m getting there. I’ve got Aaron Franklin and Matty Matheson cookbooks to prove it, so I’m clearly prepared for the journey when it comes.
